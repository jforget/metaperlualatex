Installation
------------

You need to install Perl, lualatex and perltex. If you want to compile
the   sun.tex   file,   you   have   to  install   the   Perl   module
DateTime::Event::Sunrise with its prerequisites.

Perl  and perltex  are rather  bug-free,  so they  should not  present
problems. lualatex is  still in active beta development,  so you might
have problems.   And if  you need DateTime::Event::Sunrise,  beware of
the version, there was a big bug up to version 0.0501.

Perl
----

You need  at least Perl 5.10,  but since most  distributions provide a
more recent Perl, you can use the Perl installed with your system.  Or
you  can install  a Perl  interpreter  with perlbrew.  Unless you  use
bleadperl, you should not encounter problems.

mpll
----

Just copy  the file  into some directory  from your  $PATH environment
variable.

perltex
-------

You   should  try  first   the  perltex   package  provided   by  your
distribution.   If you  need to  reinstall lualatex  (see  below), you
should reinstall perltex at the same time and from the same source.

lualatex
--------

At  first,  you should  try  the  lualatex  package provided  by  your
distribution.  And you should check it with

  mpll check-mp.tex

If you obtain "Output written  on check-mp.pdf", you are lucky and you
can skip to the next paragraph.

If  you obtain an  error similar  to "Bad  argument to  format (string
expected, got nil)", then you must install a new lualatex interpreter.
For this, download a recent snapshot of tex-live and then run

  install-tl

from the directory where you have downloaded the tex-live snapshot.
Or you can use

  tlmgr

After that, you  must again try to compile  chek-mp.tex. If you obtain
an error  about "Illegal unit  of measure", then you  must comment-out
the line requiring  the mplib package and activate  the line requiring
the luatexko-mplib  package. It is  sufficient to place the  two files
for this  package in the same  directory as the  whatever.tex file you
are compiling.

And if you  obtain an error about some unknown  dialect, do not worry.
It is a harmless compatibility error between Babel and lualatex.

DateTime::Event::Sunrise
------------------------

Make sure you install the latest version, at least 0.0502.
