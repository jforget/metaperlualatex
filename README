Presentation
------------

This  repository  gives a  utility  to  merge  the functionalities  of
lualatex and of perltex.  Now, you can typeset documents using scripts
written in Lua and in Perl. And figures in Metapost.

Also provided in this repository, soleil.tex is a showcase for the new
utility,  a Latex  document which  uses Perl,  Lua and  Metapost. This
document is also  stored as soleil.pdf, so you  can compare soleil.tex
with soleil.pdf  and imagine how  the PDF file was  generated, without
having to install mpll.

Installation
------------

You  need to  install first  lualatex and  perltex, either  using your
system package manager, or  some TEX distribution's package manager. I
used tlmgr from Tex-Live.

Then you copy the mpll script to a directory from $PATH. That's all.

If you want to generate soleil.pdf from soleil.tex, you need a patched
version  of DateTime::Event::Sunrise.  Install  the current  and buggy
version 0.0501 with your preferred utility cpan, cpanp or cpanm, so at
least,   you  will   have  all   prerequisites.   Then   donwload  the
DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0501.tar.gz  archive from your  favorite CPAN
mirror

  ftp://your.favorite.cpan.mirror.org/path/to/cpan/authors/id/R/RK/RKHILL/DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0501.tar.gz

and download the dt-e-sunrise.patch patch from

  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34770

Then:

  tar -zxvf DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0501.tar.gz
  mv DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0501 DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0502
  patch -p0 < dt-e-sunrise.patch
  cd DateTime-Event-Sunrise-0.0502
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install
