Presentation
------------

This  repository  gives a  utility  to  merge  the functionalities  of
lualatex and of perltex.  Now, you can typeset documents using scripts
written in Lua and in Perl. And figures in Metapost.

Also provided in this repository, soleil.tex is a showcase for the new
utility,  a Latex  document which  uses Perl,  Lua and  Metapost. This
document is also  stored as soleil.pdf, so you  can compare soleil.tex
with soleil.pdf  and imagine how  the PDF file was  generated, without
having to install mpll.
